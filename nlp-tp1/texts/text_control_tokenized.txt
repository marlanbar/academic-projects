Activation
of
the
PI3K/AKT
pathway
may
contribute
to
tumorigenesis.
AKT
mediates
survival
signals
that
protect
cells
from
apoptosis
and,
thus,
is
a
potentially
important
therapeutic
target.
To
determine
the
frequency
of
AKT
activation
in
human
ovarian
cancer,
we
screened
a
tumor
tissue
microarray
with
a
phospho-specific
pan-AKT
(Ser473)
antibody,
which
revealed
elevated
staining
in
21
of
31
(68%)
ovarian
carcinomas.
Phospho-AKT
staining
was
associated
with
that
of
phospho
(active)-mTOR
in
27
of
31
(87%)
ovarian
tumors,
with
17
(55%)
tumors
showing
elevated
phospho-mTOR
positivity.
We
tested
the
effects
of
AKT/mTOR
activation
on
the
therapeutic
sensitivity
of
ovarian
cancer
cells.
Pretreatment
of
SKOV3
cells,
which
exhibit
constitutive
AKT
activity
under
low

conditions,
with
the
PI3K
inhibitor
LY294002
augmented
cisplatin-induced
apoptosis.
In
contrast,
ovarian
cancer
cell
lines
OVCAR4
and
OVCAR5,
which
have
low
basal
levels
of
AKT
activity,
did
not
show
increased
cisplatin-induced
apoptosis
when
pretreated
with
LY294002.
In
addition,
inhibition
of
mTOR
activity
with
rapamycin
resulted
in
G1
arrest
in
SKOV3
cells,
but
not
in
OVCAR4
or
OVCAR5
cells.
Collectively,
these
findings
indicate
that
active
AKT
and
downstream
mTOR
represent
potentially
important
therapeutic
and/or
chemopreventive
targets

In
eukaryotic
cells,
amino
acid
depletion
reduces
translation
by
a
mechanism
involving
phosphorylation
of
eukaryotic
initiation
factor
2
(eIF2).
Herein
we
describe
that
mice
lacking
the
eIF2
kinase
GCN2
fail
to
alter
the
phosphorylation
of
this
initiation
factor
in
liver,
and
are
moribund
in
response
to
dietary
leucine
restriction.
Wild-type
(GCN2(+/+))
and
two
strains
of
GCN2
null
(GCN2(-/-))
mice
were
provided
a
nutritionally
complete
diet
or
a
diet
devoid
of
leucine
or
glycine
for
1h
or
6d.
In
wild-type
mice,
dietary
leucine
restriction
resulted
in
loss
of
body
weight
and
liver
mass,
yet
mice
remained
healthy.
In
contrast,
a
significant
proportion
of
GCN2(-/-)
mice
died
within
6d
of
the
leucine-deficient
diet.
Protein
synthesis
in
wild-type
livers
was
decreased
concomitant
with
increased
phosphorylation
of
eIF2
and
decreased
phosphorylation
of
4E-BP1
and
S6K1,
translation
regulators
controlled
nutritionally
by
mTOR.
While
translation
in
the
liver
was
decreased
independent
of
GCN2
activity
in
mice
fed
a
leucine-free
diet
for
1h,
protein
synthesis
in
GCN2(-/-)
mice
at
d6
was
enhanced
to
levels
measured
in
mice
fed
the
complete
diet.
Interestingly,
in
addition
to
a
block
in
eIF2
phosphorylation,
phosphorylation
of
4E-BP1
and
S6K1
was
not
decreased
in
GCN2(-/-)
mice
deprived
of
leucine
for
6d.
This
suggests
that
GCN2
activity
can
also
contribute
to
nutritional
regulation
of
the
mTOR
pathway.
As
a
result
of
the
absence
of
these
translation
inhibitory
signals,
liver
weights
were
preserved
and
instead,
skeletal
muscle
mass
was
reduced
in
GCN2(-/-)
mice
fed
a
leucine-free
diet.
This
study
indicates
that
loss
of
GCN2
eIF2
kinase
activity
shifts
the
normal
maintenance
of
protein
mass
away
from
skeletal
muscle
to
provide
substrate
for
continued
hepatic
translation.
