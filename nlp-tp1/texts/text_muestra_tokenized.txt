At
least
two
people
were
killed
and
several
others
injured
Thursday
morning
when
a
wall
at
a
Houston
mall
collapsed
as
employees
and
shoppers
prepared
for
the
beginning
of
the
business
day.
Dr.
Smith,
an
M.D.
and
P.M.D.
from
Health
Works
Inc.,
located
in
the
S.E.
part
of
the
city,
reported
that
he
would
not
expect
anyone
still
alive
under
the
rubble.
<PP>
Rescuers
began
combing
through
the
rubble
at
the
Northline
Mall,
attempting
to
reach
anyone
who
could
be
trapped

"
Reports
are
that
some
people
were
walking
in
that
particular
area
and
we
just
do
not
know
how
many,
"
Houston
Fire
Chief
Eddie
Corral
said.
"
We'll
just
have
to
see
as
we
pull
the
rocks
and
things
out,
"
Mr.
Corral
said.

The
wall
collapsed
at
about
9
a.m.
(10
a.m.
EST)
in
a
store
that
was
undergoing
renovations.
But
it
was
not
immediately
clear
what
caused
the
collapse,
authorities
said.
The
section
of
the
wall
that
collapsed
was
about
18
feet
high
and
150
feet
long.

Rick
Flanigan,
a
spokesman
for
the
Houston
Fire
Department,
said
an
employee
had
just
greeted
shoppers
walking
into
the
mall
when
a
loud
noise
echoed
throughout
the
building.
"
Apparently
that's
when
the
collapse
took
place,
"
he
said.
<PP>
Earlier
officials
had
said
three
were
dead.
The
identities
of
those
killed
have
not
been
released.
Flanigan
said
at
least
one
of
the
injured
is
in
critical
condition.
